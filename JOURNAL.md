# June 28th: 

Today i started by making the basic schematic and researching on how the keyboard will actually work over bluetooth.

![Schematic](images/June-28.png)

My initial impression was that ill have to program pico via arduino ide for ble, but it turns out that kmk has support for ble.
Will probably save me a lot of trouble later on when making the firmware.

Also man did it take time to get all the keys in the schematic.

I will pretty sure change the matrix a lot while ill do the wiring in the pcb editor so i didnt think much about them right now.

**Total time spent: 5h**
